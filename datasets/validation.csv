"Russia, Saudi Arabia cement new friendship with king's visit","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Saudi Arabia s King Salman for talks at the Kremlin on Thursday, cementing a relationship that is pivotal for world oil prices and could decide the outcome of the conflict in Syria. King Salman, the first sitting Saudi monarch ever to visit Russia, led a delegation to Moscow that agreed joint investment deals worth several billion dollars, providing much-needed investment for a Russian economy battered by low oil prices and Western sanctions. Saudi Arabia said it had signed a memorandum of understanding on the purchase from Russia of S-400 air defense systems. That marked a shift for the kingdom, which buys most of its military kit from the United States and Britain. On the political front, there was no sign of any substantial breakthrough on the issues that have long divided Moscow and Riyadh, including the fact that they back rival sides in Syria s war. However, any discord was eclipsed by mutual expressions of respect, and the pomp and ceremony laid on by Russian officials to greet the Saudi king.  On his journey into central Moscow from Vnukovo airport late on Wednesday, King Salman s limousine passed billboards bearing his photograph and messages in Russian and Arabic welcoming him. On Thursday, Putin received the monarch in the gold-decorated St. Andrew Hall, one of the grandest spaces in the Kremlin, attended by soldiers in ceremonial dress and with an orchestra playing their countries  national anthems.  I am sure that your visit will provide a good impulse for the development of relations between our two states,  Putin told King Salman later as they sat alongside each other in the Kremlin s lavishly-decorated Green Parlour. Russia and Saudi Arabia, despite their differences, have been drawn together by a common interest in propping up flagging world oil prices, and by the fact that Moscow, since its military intervention in Syria, has clout in the Middle East that other players in the region cannot ignore.  The Saudi king invited Putin to visit his country - an offer the Russian leader accepted - and said they planned to keep cooperating to keep world oil prices stable. Moscow and Riyadh worked together to secure a deal between OPEC and other oil producers to cut output until the end of March 2018, helping support prices. Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said Saudi Arabia was  flexible  regarding Moscow s suggestion to extend the pact until the end of next year. The message of further joint Saudi-Russia action on output helped push up oil prices on Thursday. Brent crude was up more than 2 percent at $57.12 a barrel by 1615 GMT. In Syria, Riyadh supports rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad s army, while Russian and Iranian forces have sided with Assad. This leaves Moscow aligned with Saudi Arabia s arch-rival Iran, whose influence Riyadh fears is growing in the region. Briefing the media after the talks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov focused on the common ground, saying the two leaders had agreed on the importance of fighting terrorism, finding peaceful solutions to conflicts in the Middle East, and on the principle of territorial integrity. His Saudi counterpart, Adel al-Jubeir, said new horizons had opened for Russia-Saudi ties that he could not previously have imagined.   Relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia have reached a historical moment,  said Jubeir, speaking through an interpreter.  We are certain that the further strengthening of Russian-Saudi relations will have a positive impact on strengthening stability and security in the region and the world.  A package of investments announced during the visit will go some way to plugging the vacuum left by sluggish Western investment in Russia that is, in part, a result of sanctions imposed after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. Among the deals was an agreement between Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF and Saudi Arabia s Public Investment Fund to invest up to $100 million in transport projects in Russia. The two countries also signed a deal to set up a $1 billion joint investment fund.  Another memorandum of understanding was signed under which Russian petrochemicals firm Sibur would explore cooperation with Saudi Arabia.  RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev said his fund was interested in partnering with Saudi investors to acquire a minority stake in Russian oilfield services firm Eurasia Drilling. Absent from the slew of deals was any agreement on Saudi Aramco taking a stake in an Arctic liquefied natural gas project run by Russia s Novatek. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said earlier this month that Saudi officials were studying joint gas projects with Novatek. However, Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser said such a deal was not being discussed at this stage. ",1
Divided Catalans prepare to vote in close-run election,"VIC/CERDANYOLA DEL VALLES, Spain (Reuters) - Catalonia votes on Thursday for a new administration in an election many hope will resolve Spain s worst crisis in decades after the region declared independence leading Madrid to sack local leaders. Polls suggest neither the pro-independence nor the pro-unity camp will win a majority. The likely outcome is a hung parliament and many weeks of wrangling to form a new regional government. In the separatist heartland of rural Catalonia, fireman Josep Sales says he hopes the results will endorse the result of an Oct. 1 illegal referendum on independence from Spain and lead to the creation of a republic.  If we get a majority, something will have to be done. And if the politicians don t do it, the people will unite,  he said, speaking from the town fire station where many of the red fire engines bear the slogan  Hello Democracy .  If we have to bring the country to a standstill, so be it,  said the 45-year-old, who plans to vote for Carles Puigdemont, the sacked Catalan head who is campaigning for election from self-imposed exile in Belgium.  The uncertainty generated by the independence drive has hurt hotel occupancy rates in the region, dented consumer sales and caused more than 3,000 businesses to move their registered headquarters from Catalonia. It has also bitterly divided Catalan society between those who support independence and those who favor unity with Spain.  Everyone is eager for the election and to see how it turns out, because nothing is clear at the moment,  said 34-year-old flamenco teacher Maria Gonzalez, who lives in Cerdanyola del Valles, an industrial suburb of Barcelona.  The feeling on the streets is not comfortable,  says Gonzalez, the daughter of migrants from other parts of Spain who moved to Catalonia decades ago and who plans to vote for pro-unity party Ciudadanos ( Citizens ).  There s a hidden tension.  ",1
Judge in Michigan blocks deportation of 100 Iraqis,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the deportation of about 100 Iraqi nationals rounded up in Michigan in recent weeks who argued that they could face persecution or torture in Iraq because they are religious minorities. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith in Michigan issued an order staying the deportation of the Iraqis for at least two weeks as he decides whether he has jurisdiction over the matter. Goldsmith said it was unclear whether the Iraqis would ultimately succeed.  The arrests shocked the close-knit Iraqi community in Michigan. Six Michigan lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives urged the government to hold off on the removals until Congress can be given assurances about the deporteesÉ?? safety. The Michigan arrests were part of a coordinated sweep in recent weeks by immigration authorities who detained about 199 Iraqi immigrants around the country. They had final deportation orders and convictions for serious crimes.  The roundup followed IraqÉ??s agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from President Donald TrumpÉ??s revised temporary travel ban.  Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago, but they had been allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them. That changed after the two governments came to the agreement in March. A U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment on the ruling. Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union representing the Iraqis in Michigan, said: É??The courtÉ??s action today was legally correct and may very well have saved numerous people from abuse and possible death.É?ù The U.S. government has argued that the district court does not have jurisdiction over the case. Only immigration courts can decide deportation issues, which can then only be reviewed by an appeals court, it said. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said that people with convictions for murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, burglary and drugs and weapons charges were among the Iraqis arrested nationwide. The ACLU argued that many of those affected in Michigan are Chaldean Catholics who are É??widely recognized as targets of brutal persecution in Iraq.É?ù  Some Kurdish Iraqis were also picked up in Nashville, Tennessee. In a letter on Thursday, Tennessee Representative Jim Cooper, a Democrat, asked the Iraqi ambassador whether Iraq would be able to ensure safe passage for them if they were returned. ",1
"White House seeks $44 billion hurricane aid, far short of requests","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday said it had asked Congress for $44 billion in supplemental disaster assistance to help those hurt by recent hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands, far short of the aid some officials have called for. The White House said it expected to seek additional funds after a fuller analysis. U.S. Representative Frank Pallone and Senator Ron Wyden, both Democrats, called the request É??a dereliction of duty by the Trump administration to American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands that need our help. É??This woefully inadequate funding request does not provide the necessary resources required to properly respond to the ongoing humanitarian crisis,É?ù they added. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello asked for $94.4 billion to rebuild the U.S. territoryÉ??s infrastructure. Texas was seeking $61 billion and Florida had asked for $27 billion. The $44 billion would be in addition to about $50 billion Congress previously approved for hurricane and disaster relief. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan that the $44 billion É??does not represent the final requestÉ?ù for assistance for the victims, especially in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where needs were still being assessed. É??At this time, the administration is requesting an additional fiscal year 2018 funding in the amount of $44 billion and the necessary authorities to address ongoing recovery efforts,É?ù Mulvaney said in the letter. The administration also wants Congress to approve new tax relief for victims of recent California wildfires, which mirror what Congress awarded recently to hurricane victims. The White House also wants to make houses of worship eligible for disaster relief funding. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, on Thursday dismissed the latest request as É??wholly inadequateÉ?ù for his state. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders defended the request. É??Up until this point Texas has not put any state dollars into this process. We feel strongly that they should step up and play a role and work with the federal government in this process. We did a thorough assessment and that was completed and this was the number that we put forward to Congress today,É?ù she said. She said the new request É??primarily addresses Texas and Florida Those storms took place ahead of Puerto Rico. The assessment for Puerto Rico hasnÉ??t been completed yet. Once thatÉ??s done, we fully anticipate that there will be additional requests at that time.É?ù ",1
Immigrants in limbo as U.S. top court weighs Obama action,"BALTIMORE (Reuters) - In the port city of Baltimore, where Europeans once streamed into America after crossing the Atlantic by ship, a 47-year-old immigrant named Rhonda is in a desperate position. She said she wants to provide for her teenage daughter but cannot get a work permit because she is in the United States illegally. É??IÉ??d like, as a parent, to provide for my daughterÉ??s needs. Homelessness and moving around has been rough,É?ù said Rhonda, a native of Trinidad and Tobago who has lived in the United States since 2001 and spoke on condition that her last name not be used to protect her daughter. In Houston, Daniel Castillo Garcia said he is apprehensive about his toddler sonÉ??s future because the 19-year-old Mexican native is in deportation proceedings after being picked up by U.S. federal agents near the border. É??IÉ??m very worried for my son because I need to provide for him,É?ù said Garcia, who has lived in the United States since being brought into the country by his mother as a child in 2007. For these two and many others like them, perhaps their only realistic hope is that the U.S. Supreme Court revives President Barack ObamaÉ??s 2014 executive action on immigration, which was thrown out by a lower court. That plan was designed to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, do not have a criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. RhondaÉ??s 16-year-old daughter and GarciaÉ??s 2-year-old son are citizens by virtue of being born in the United States. The court hears the case on Monday and is due to rule by the end of June. Rhonda said she cannot get a work permit because she overstayed her original 10-year visa. She and her daughter are staying in temporary housing provided by her church because she has no income. For a year, she was separated from her daughter, who plays the violin and hopes to attend college, because they could find nowhere to live together. Rhonda, who said her Christian faith keeps her positive, believes work authorization would make the difference because employers increasingly demand such documentation. É??ThatÉ??s why IÉ??m in such hardship. IÉ??m very anxious for something to happen,É?ù she said. In BaltimoreÉ??s heavily Latino FellÉ??s Point neighborhood, South Broadway is lined with store fronts advertising services in Spanish, ranging from tax preparation to cellphone providers. Catholic Charities runs an immigrant resource center offering legal advice as well as education and health services. Its managing attorney, Adonia Simpson, said about half the roughly 600 people she counsels annually have no option beyond ObamaÉ??s program, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), if they want to legalize their status and get work permits. Initial enthusiasm about ObamaÉ??s plan waned when a federal judge put it on hold in February 2015, just before it was due to begin. All Simpson can do for now is ask clients to gather documentation to be ready to apply. É??The community is getting very discouraged,É?ù Simpson said. In Maryland alone, about 56,000 people could be eligible for the DAPA program, according to the Migration Policy Institute think tank. ObamaÉ??s plan was challenged by Texas and 25 other states that argued he exceeded his authority in bypassing Congress to take the actions. É??The president has violated the Constitution, and we are trying to prevent the president from implementing executive action that we believe is lawless,É?ù Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said. The Supreme Court is hearing the case at a time when immigration has become a hot issue in the U.S. presidential campaign, with top Republican contenders calling for all illegal immigrants to be deported. An estimated 11 million immigrants are in the country illegally. In Houston, Garcia has pinned his hopes on the court reinstating ObamaÉ??s program. É??DAPA will help me get that freedom and help me to keep going and have a good future for myself and my son,É?ù Garcia said in an interview translated from Spanish by his attorney. ",1
WHOA! CHICAGO TRIBUNE: É??If Nation Was More Important To Democrats Than PowerÉ?ùÉ??They Would É??Ask Her To Step Down NowÉ?ù,"This is hands down the best commentary yet on the Democrats and the crooked, defiant and arrogant Hillary. The Democrats are notorious for being a party that refuses to back down, and they re not backing down now, even if it means losing the respect and trust of an entire nation. Party first. That s how its always been with the Dems, and their circle of protection, including lie after lie that is being told to defend her only proves that there are no exceptions to that rule Has America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc. that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president, even after Friday s FBI announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state?We ll find out soon enough.It s obvious the American political system is breaking down. It s been crumbling for some time now, and the establishment elite know it and they re properly frightened. Donald Trump, the vulgarian at their gates, is a symptom, not a cause. Hillary Clinton and husband Bill are both cause and effect.FBI director James Comey s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious.This can t be about pervert Anthony Weiner and his reported desire for a teenage girl. But it can be about the laptop of Weiner s wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and emails between her and Hillary. It comes after the FBI investigation in which Comey concluded Clinton had lied and been  reckless  with national secrets, but said he could not recommend prosecution.So what should the Democrats do now?If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process:They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place.Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea.Since Oct. 7, WikiLeaks has released 35,000 emails hacked from Clinton campaign boss John Podesta. Now WikiLeaks, no longer a neutral player but an active anti-Clinton agency, plans to release another 15,000 emails.What if she is elected? Think of a nation suffering a bad economy and continuing chaos in the Middle East, and now also facing a criminal investigation of a president. Add to that congressional investigations and a public vision of Clinton as a Nixonian figure wandering the halls, wringing her hands.The best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now. It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media   fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton s political action committee   should begin demanding it.But what will Hillary do?She ll stick and ride this out and turn her anger toward Comey. For Hillary and Bill Clinton, it has always been about power, about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence.She ll remind the nation that she s a woman and that Donald Trump said terrible things about women. If there is another notorious Trump video to be leaked, the Clintons should probably leak it now. Then her allies in media can talk about misogyny and sexual politics and the headlines can be all about Trump as the boor he is and Hillary as champion of female victims, which she has never been.Remember that Bill Clinton leveraged the  Year of the Woman.  Then he preyed on women in the White House and Hillary protected him. But the political left   most particularly the women of the left   defended him because he promised to protect abortion rights and their other agendas.If you take a step back from tribal politics, you ll see that Mrs. Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again. If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job, Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record. She d never be hired.As secretary of state she kept classified documents on the home-brew server in her basement, which is against the law. She lied about it to the American people. She couldn t remember details dozens of times when questioned by the FBI. Her aides destroyed evidence by BleachBit and hammers. Her husband, Bill, met secretly on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for about a half-hour, and all they said they talked about was golf and the grandkids.And there was no prosecution of Hillary.That isn t merely wrong and unethical. It is poisonous.And during this presidential campaign, Americans were confronted with a two-tiered system of federal justice: one for standards for the Clintons and one for the peasants.For entire article: Chicago Tribune",0
 Watch The Moving Apology To The LGBTQ Community From UtahÉ??s GOP Lt. Gov. That Every Republican Should See,"The GOP is notoriously hostile to the LGBTQ community. Generally, we reject gay republicans, and the former leader of gay GOP group GOProud actually denounced his membership in the GOP, and obviously with good reason. In the wake of the horrible attack on our community in Orlando, many GOP politicians continued to erase us from our own tragedy, prompting rightful and renewed outrage from the LGBTQ community and our allies. I myself wrote a scathing indictment of the GOPers offering thoughts and prayers while still legislating hate. However, there is one member of that party who, once a homophobe, is a million percent on our side now, and he deserves to be recognized for that: Utah Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox.Taking to the stage at a Salt Lake City vigil in honor of the 49 victims of the Orlando shooting Monday night, Cox showed that his words were not empty, that they were heartfelt. First, he apologized for treating LGBTQ people poorly in the past. From Vox:Cox started off saying that he had  an admission and an apology  for the vigil attendees:  I recognize fully that I am a balding, youngish, middle-aged straight, white, male, Republican politician  (many in the crowd burst into laughter at this)  with all of the expectations and privileges that come with those labels. I am probably not who you expected to hear from today. After that humble introduction, Cox went on to say: I m here because yesterday morning, 49 Americans were brutally murdered.   I m here because those 49 people were gay. I m here because it shouldn t matter. But I m here because it does. That is perhaps, to me as a gay American, the most moving part of the speech, period. It shows that he isn t erasing us, that he understands that no amount of rallying in the streets, pride parades, people coming out in support of marriage equality, or anything else changes the fact that this community has suffered terrible amounts of violence, indignity, disrespect, and despair, all for the simple  crime  of existing. Cox went on to address the problem of straight-splaining, and admits that while he stands with us, he cannot know what it is like to walk a mile in our shoes: I am not here to tell you that I know exactly what you are going through. I am not here to tell you that I feel your pain. I don t pretend to know the depths of what you are feeling right now. But I do know what it feels like to be scared. And I do know what it feels like to be sad. And I do know what it feels like to be rejected. And, more importantly, I know what it feels like to be loved. The speech went on to call the victims  beautiful, amazing people,  and Cox was tearful throughout. This speech is not the only thing Cox has done to show his allegiance and support though. He was a vocal supporter of a Utah law that forbade discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.There is so much more than what I have written here in this beautiful, moving 9:39 speech. I urge you to listen to every word. Take it in. I hope it makes it to the computer screens of Lt. Gov. Cox s fellow Republicans. Perhaps some of them will be able to have a similar change of heart.Watch this amazing speech below: Featured image via kuer.org/Spencer Cox",0

POCAHONTAS WARREN Wants GOPÉ??s ScalpÉ??Tells Crowd SheÉ??d Like To É??Cut Open RepublicansÉ?ù [VIDEO],"The woman who wants to be the next Democrat candidate for president is doing exactly what Democrats do best these days, expressing their desire to harm anyone who holds an opposing political view. Oh, we know fake indian and US Senator Elizabeth Warren was only kidding when she told a crowd that she would like to  cut the Republicans open . After all, she s just pandering to her base. Isn t that how the majority of Democrats operate these days? Trash Trump suggest violence against his supporters then talk about how intolerant Republicans are.In a discussion about the repeal of Obamacare, Democrat Elizabeth Warren (who is famous for lying on her application to Harvard and University of Pennsylvania about having Cherokee and Delaware Indian heritage) mocked the Republicans attempt at offering Americans a better option than the horribly failed government controlled health care that Warren voted to support. I hope they leave their bodies to science. I would like to cut them open,  Warren said during an event in Chicago on Saturday. God, what planet do they live on?  Warren asked, before sharing her wish to cut open their bodies.Warren then told the crowd she hoped Republicans donated their bodies to science so she could  cut them open  when they died.Ladies and Gentlemen Introducing the the first  Native American  presidential candidate for 2020 The future face of the Democrat Party LOL!",0
 Elizabeth Warren Announces That A Major For Profit School Is Banned From Accepting Students,"If there s one thing Elizabeth Warren hates, it s when ordinary citizens get the wool pulled over their eyes and are taken advantage of by greedy corporations.In an effort to make at least one company no longer have the ability to cheat students out of a proper education and tens of thousands of dollars, ITT Tech will no longer be allowed to accept students.Warren took to Facebook to make the announcement: ITT Tech   a massive, for-profit college   is currently under investigation by 20 state and federal agencies for cheating students. The SEC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey are all suing them for fraud. ITT Tech failed, again, to meet the scandalously low standards of its accrediting agency, but still sucked down a whopping $600 million in taxpayer dollars last year.Today, the Department of Education has finally declared that enough is enough, banning ITT Tech from enrolling any new students with federal student loan and grant dollars this fall. ITT s free ride is finally over, and the message couldn t be clearer: We will no longer stand by and allow these shady institutions to bilk taxpayers and cheat students. https://www.facebook.com/senatorelizabethwarren/posts/636549976507499Warren also posts a link that explains what is happening and what current students can do or expect. Part of the article explains:As a current ITT student with federal loans, you have some options:You can continue your courses at ITT with your federal student aid. There s no immediate change to your program.You can transfer your credits to a new school (if that school accepts them) and complete your education.You can pause your education and wait to see how this matter resolves itself in the coming months. If ITT closes before you finish your program and you don t transfer your credits, you will likely be eligible to discharge your federal loans.This is huge news, and long overdue. All too often these for-profit schools continue to take money while providing subpar education, often not properly accredited. These schools spend more on advertising than education and take advantage of people who may not necessarily realize they are being robbed.It is wonderful to finally see some justice be made and watch at least another one of these scam schools be given what is long overdue.Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",0
